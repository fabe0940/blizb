The premise is: you are shooting a heat ray into the sky from a mobile snowplow
with a mounted heat gun that drives to and fro across the bottom of the screen,
which represents a vital arterial street that it is your job to keep clear. Snow
is coming in thicker and thicker as time progresses, but you can shoot the
flakes if you can get under them. Your gun moves very quickly from side to side.
If you fail to shoot a flake and it lands on the ground, it sticks, and the more
snow that accumulates, the slower the snowplow's movement. The snowplow can
maybe grind down some of the snow, and shove it off to the side, but it is a
battle that you can never win. The game is over when the snowplow can no longer
move.
