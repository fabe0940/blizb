Blizzard Blast
==============


Compilation
-----------

Just run `make`. An executable named `blizb` will be generated.


Playing
-------

The goal of the game is to accumulate points by shooting down the snow
which is covering the city. As snow accumulates, however, your vehicle
will move more and more slowly, until you can no longer move and the
game ends.


Controls
--------

Use the left and right arrows to move your vehicle. Press the spacebar
to fire a snow melting laser beam.



Notes
-----

I made up some nice sprites for this game with my roommate, but I was
unable to get image code to work in unicon. Thus, the player is the
blue rectangle, the snowflakes are the white rectangles, and the
lasers are the red rectangles.
